# ðŸ“° News and Information Hub  

## Overview  
This project is a **News and Information Hub** that fetches, analyzes, and ranks web content based on relevance and readability. It integrates **web scraping, NLP, topic modeling, and abstractive summarization** to provide users with high-quality, topic-specific content.  

## Features  
âœ… **Bing Search Integration** â€“ Fetches top relevant links based on a keyword query.  
âœ… **Web Scraping** â€“ Extracts text from fetched URLs, filtering out social media sites.  
âœ… **Text Preprocessing** â€“ Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for effective analysis.  
âœ… **Topic Modeling** â€“ Identifies key topics using **LDA, NMF, and LSA** models.  
âœ… **Readability Scoring** â€“ Ranks websites based on **Flesch Reading Ease** score.  
âœ… **Abstractive Summarization** â€“ Uses **Facebook BART** for high-quality text summarization.  
âœ… **Flask Web Interface** â€“ Provides an intuitive UI for users to interact with the system.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python** (requests, lxml, nltk, sklearn, transformers, textstat)  
- **Machine Learning** (TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, Truncated SVD)  
- **Deep Learning** (BART for summarization)  
- **Flask** (Backend API)  
- **HTML & CSS** (Frontend UI)  


## Usage  
1. Enter a **keyword/topic** in the search bar.  
2. The system **fetches and processes** relevant articles.
